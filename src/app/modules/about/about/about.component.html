                        <p>My mission, for now, is to build a Frankenstein-website that includes a set of small tools and utilities that may or may not be useful for my users or visitors.  If you could find something helpful during your visit, that is great, just keep using it!</p>

                        <p>As you may know, the website will not have a main theme or service like other websites, however, the website will keep growing whenever an idea comes out of my mind. Oh! Lastly, if you have any idea, please contact me, I would love to hear your ideas!</p>
