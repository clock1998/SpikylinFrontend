Hello all, this is my personal website. It has a landing page, an about page. a gallery and a blog. More functionalities will be added in the future. 

Since it is built in Angular, you can follow the standard Angular way to build or serve the project. 

Thanks.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.
